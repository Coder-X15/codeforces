# Codeforces - My Practice Diary

Uhh , I'm not sure what to write here. I guess I'll just write about my practice diary. This is where I keep all of the problems I do, and I'll try and update it as frequently as I can :)

Btw, my C++ include path doesn't have `bits/stdc++.h` for some reason so Imma just use the standard libraries as they are.

Access this page for the ordered list of problems (posting here cuz I'm lazy: [Problems in Ascending Order - Codeforces](ttps://codeforces.com/problemset/page/1?order=BY_RATING_ASC))
